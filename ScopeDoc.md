## Summary
This document outlines the specifications of the Senior Center App Project for the Belgrade Senior Center.

## Objective

### Business Need
The Belgrade Senior Center wants to be able to electronically record, store and reference client data in their center. They need to be able to view and manage all their clients via a web app. It would allow the clients to be sorted and contacted based on characteristics or events they have attended. There would also be a view that allows clients to sign into events. 

### Proposed Solution
...

## Product Description

### Desired Functionality
- Data Stored about Clients:
  - name
  - address
  - birthday -> age
  - phone number
  - email address
  - emergency contacts (name, address, phone number, relationship)+
  - medical information (diets, allergies, disabilities, medications, medical issues)
  - membership status (start date and renewal data)
  - meals (home delivered vs. in center, combination?)
  - activities of interest (for mailing lists) (multiple levels i.e. there are many different classes offered under 'fitness classes')
  - services used (blood pressure checks, tax services, driving courses, educational classes)
  - Number of duplicated and unduplicated members for each activity and service (?)
  - volunteers (?)
  - notes section for other more unpredictable information?
- Be able to print reports for grant writing
- Easily add new services and activities
- Administrators have full access to edit all data
- Volunteers have more limited data access
- Members can register themselves for events (register in advance or sign in?)

#### Questions
1. Who is maintaining client profiles? Should they be able to see/edit their own data in any way?
2. Are there different membership levels?
3. Are there any clients who take both home delivered and in center meals?
4. Should we be able to store medical information like from the blood pressure checks?
5. What's the difference between the activities of interest and the services used (yoga classes and educational classes seem like they should be in the same category)?
6. What are duplicated and unduplicated members?
7. For managing volunteers, are the seniors doing the volunteering or are other community members volunteering at the senior center?
8. Should members be able to register in advance for classes? Or just sign in when they get there?
8. Information (eventually) needed:
	- lists of classes/activities offered
	- example reports for grants
